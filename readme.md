# Quantom Leap
What if we could redesign the UI of the linux desktop from scratch?

## Build & installation
```
meson setup build
sudo ninja -C build install
```

## Todo
  - Begin porting to zig file by file
  - Implement font rendering
  - Implement a basic vim-like text editor
  - Implement a keybinding to recompile and reload
  - Implement super fluid scrolling
