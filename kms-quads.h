 * An 'output' is our abstractive structure of a plane -> CRTC -> connector
 * display pipeline.
 *
 * Working backwards:
 *   - the connector represents a connection to a physical device, i.e. one
 *     monitor; connectors have native modes (usually coming from the output
 *     device's EDID), a number of properties describing properties of the
 *     device and output stream such as 'Broadcast RGB' which informs the
 *     device of the colour encoding and range
 *   - the CRTC is responsible for generating the image to display on one or
 *     more connectors; its main property is the mode, which configures the
 *     output resolution, as well as various other important properties such
 *     as gamma/CTM/degamma for colour management; the CRTC produces this
 *     output by combining images fed to it by one or more ...
 *   - planes take an input image (via framebuffers), optionally crop and
 *     scale the image, and then place that image within the CRTC; they have
 *     some properties such as zpos (for ordering overlapping planes) and
 *     colour management
 *
 * To simplify things, we define each output as one plane -> CRTC -> connector
 * chain. We pick a connector, find a CRTC which works with that connector
 * (searching back through the encoder, which is a deprecated and unused KMS
 * object), then find a primary plane which works with that CRTC.
 *
 * There are multiple types of planes: primary planes are usually used to
 * show a single flat fullscreen image, overlay planes are used to display
 * content on top of this which is blended by the display controller (often
 * video content), and cursor planes are almost exclusively used for mouse
 * cursors. For our uses, we only care about primary planes.
 *
 * Note that _only_ overlay planes will be enumerated by default; enabling
 * the 'universal planes' client capability causes the kernel to advertise
 * primary and cursor planes to us.
